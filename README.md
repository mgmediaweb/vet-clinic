# Vet Clinic Database

> In this exercise I was working on creating the table and the necessary queries to insert and list the results on the screen.

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. 

## Getting Started

Query required:

- [x] Find all animals whose name ends in "mon".
```
SELECT * FROM animals WHERE name LIKE '%mon';
```
